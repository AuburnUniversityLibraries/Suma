This may be a faster way to try Suma before following these installation instructions. \nWe do not recommend this for production use.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nThese requirements are based on our local testing. Earlier versions may also work:\n\n\n\n\nMySQL recommended version 5.1\n\n\nApache recommended version 2.2\n\n\nPHP required version of at least 5.3.3 (including cURL)\n\n\nZend Framework 1.12 - required for Suma server, included with Suma code\n\n\nVarious Javascript Libraries - all included with Suma code\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Client Requirements:\n\n\n\n\nDevice or computer with WebKit browser (e.g. iOS and Android browsers, Google Chrome, Safari on Mac OS) needed to use Suma client. \nNOTE: Suma does not work in Safari for Windows.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Suma\n\n\nYou can find the \nlatest Suma version\n on GitHub.\n\n\nNote path to suma download directory.  We will refer to this as SUMA_DOWNLOAD_DIR\n\n\nSuma Software Installation (symbolic links, \nRECOMMENDED\n)\n\n\nIf your Apache configuration has the \nFollowSymLinks\n directive enabled, there is a simpler way to deploy Suma that also improves the update process.\n\n\n\n\nClone the GitHub repository to a directory outside of your web space (e.g. \n/var/www/app/suma\n)\n\n\nCreate the following symbolic links from your web space to the local suma repository (these instructions make several assumptions about paths and directory names--please change as needed, noting the configuration directions later in this document):\n/var/www/htdocs/sumaserver/      =\n  /var/www/app/suma/service/web/\n/var/www/htdocs/suma/client/        =\n  /var/www/app/suma/web/\n/var/www/htdocs/suma/analysis/   =\n  /var/www/app/suma/analysis/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow all of your code is in one place, allowing you to update Suma by running \ngit pull --rebase origin master\n. There is a chance this could result in merge conflicts with your local changes, so please allow for time to resolve these before updating.\n\n\nSuma Software Installation (file copying)\n\n\nFor Suma Client Installation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy contents of \n/SUMA_DOWNLOAD_DIR/web\n to \n/YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/web\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy contents of \n/SUMA_DOWNLOAD_DIR/analysis\n to \n/YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Suma Server Installation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy contents of \n/SUMA_DOWNLOAD_DIR/service\n to a location outside your web directory. For example, if your web directory is \n/var/www/htdocs\n you could copy the contents of the \n/SUMA_DOWNLOAD_DIR/service\n to \n/var/www/app/sumaserver\n.\n\n\nNote this location, we will refer to it later as \nSUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy contents of \n/SUMA_DOWNLOAD_DIR/service/web\n to \n/YOUR_WEB_DIR/sumaserver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Configuration\n\n\nYou can configure your apache web server two ways using apache's configuration rewrite engine or using a .htaccess file\n\n\nApache rewrite\nIf using Apache's rewrite module add these lines in your web server (likely httpd.conf) configuration file\n\n\nDirectory \"/YOUR_WEB_DIR/sumaserver\"\n\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [NC,L]\n\n/Directory\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to change \nYOUR_WEB_DIR\n to the directory in your web space that contains the \nservice/web/\n content\n\nRestart apache after adding these lines for configuration to apply.\n\n\n.htaccess\nIf using a .htaccess place the file in the \n/YOUR_WEB_DIR/sumaserver\n directory and add these lines\n\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]\nRewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [NC,L]\n\n\n\nAn example .htaccess file named can be found at \n/YOUR_WEB_DIR/sumaserver/htaccess_example\n. To use, copy the contents of this file to a new file named \n/YOUR_WEB_DIR/sumaserver/.htaccess\n.\n\n\nDatabase Setup\n\n\nIt is recommended you create two databases for Suma. One for production and one for testing. The database instructions are the same for both except for changing the database name.\n\n\nCreate database in MySQL using whatever tool you have available.\n\n\nCreate two Suma accounts:\n\n\n\n\nOne administrative account with \nSELECT\n, \nINSERT\n, \nCREATE\n, \nDROP\n, \nDELETE\n, \nUPDATE\n, \nINDEX\n, and \nALTER\n permissions. \nThis account is for initializing and modifying the database. Do not include this account in your Suma configuration.\n\n\nOne application account with \nSELECT\n, \nINSERT\n, \nUPDATE\n, and \nINDEX\n permissions.\n\n\n\n\nNow you have to run a database initialization script included in the suma download.\n\n\n\n\nFind the file schema.sql in \n/SUMA_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION/service/config\n.\n\n\n\n\nRun that script to initialize database, create suma tables, and establish foreign key constraints.\n\n\nTo run it you can use the command line MySQL tools, phpmyadmin, or any other database management tool you like. \nThis should be imported using the Suma administration MySQL account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional, but recommended:\n If you wish to initialize the database with preloaded sample data so you can play around with Suma more quickly, then run the \nschema_w_sample.sql\n script instead of \nschema.sql\n.\n\n\n\n\nSuma Server Software Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nservice/web/config/config.yaml\n\n\nIn the \n/SUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR/web/config/\n directory, copy \nconfig_example.yaml\n to a new file \nconfig.yaml\n. You must set some path variables in the \nconfig.yaml\n file for the Suma server to function correctly.\n\n\nSUMA_SERVER_PATH\n must be set to the \nSUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR\n where the Suma server was installed earlier in these instructions (e.g. \n/var/www/app/sumaserver\n).\n\n\nSUMA_CONTROLLER_PATH\n must be set to \nSUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR/controllers\n (e.g. \n/var/www/app/sumaserver/controllers\n).\n\n\nSUMA_BASE_URL\n must be set to the URL path for the Suma server. For example, if the URL is \nhttp://YOUR_HOST/sumaserver\n, set this to \n/sumaserver\n.\n\n\nSUMA_DEBUG\n can be set to \ntrue\n if you would like to see more verbose error messages. This should generally be set to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nservice/config/config.yaml\n\n\nIn the \nSUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR/config/\n directory, copy \nconfig_example.yaml\n to a new file \nconfig.yaml\n.

Refer to the instructions below for creating  config.yaml .  From the installation docs:  In the  /SUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR/web/config/  directory, copy  config_example.yaml  to a new file  config.yaml . You must set some path variables in the  config.yaml  file for the Suma server to function correctly.  SUMA_SERVER_PATH  must be set to the  SUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR  where the Suma server was installed earlier in these instructions (e.g.  /var/www/app/sumaserver ).  SUMA_CONTROLLER_PATH  must be set to  SUMA_SERVER_INSTALL_DIR/controllers  (e.g.  /var/www/app/sumaserver/controllers ).  SUMA_BASE_URL  must be set to the URL path for the Suma server. For example, if the URL is  http://YOUR_HOST/sumaserver , set this to  /sumaserver .  SUMA_DEBUG  can be set to  true  if you would like to see more verbose error messages. This should generally be set to  false .    analysis/lib/php/ServerIO.php =  analysis/config/config.yaml  Copy the  private $_baseUrl  configuration settings into the the  baseUrl  field of  analysis/config/config.yaml . Refer to the instructions below for creating  config.yaml .  From the installation docs:  In the  YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/analysis/config/  directory, copy  config_example.yaml  to a new file  config.yaml . Change  baseUrl  to the URL for your Suma Query Server. If you used a directory other than  sumaserver  in the \"Suma Software Installation\" section above, that should be reflected in this URL.    analysis/reports/nightly/nightly_config.php =  analysis/config/config.yaml  In the same  config.yaml  file created in the previous step, copy your settings from  nightly_config.php  as such:   Copy  DEFAULT_TIMEZONE  to  timezone  Copy  DAY_DISPLAY  to  displayFormat  Copy  ERROR_RECIPIENTS  to  errorRecipients  Copy  RECIPIENTS  to  recipients   From the installation docs:    To configure the nightly summary report:  In the  YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/analysis/config/config.yaml  file, edit the timezone, displayFormat, recipients, and errorRecipients as needed. See http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php for information on timezone formats.  Using cron, or some other scheduler, schedule a task to run the  YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/analysis/reports/nightly/nightlyEmail.php  script as desired.  Alternatively,  YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/analysis/reports/nightly/nightly.php  may be run from the command line for quick reporting through stdout.      web/spaceassess.js =  web/config/spaceassessConfig.js  Copy the paths  baseInitUrl ,  initiativeUrl , and  syncUrl  from spaceassess.js to the appropriate paths in  web/config/spaceassessConfig.js . Refer to the instructions below for creating  spaceassessConfig.js .  From the installation docs:  In the  YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/web/config/  directory, copy  spaceassessConfig_example.js  to a new file  spaceassessConfig.js . If the Suma server URL is anything other than  http://YOUR_HOST/sumaserver , you will need to change the paths at the top of  YOUR_WEB_DIR/suma/web/config/spaceassessConfig.js .",
